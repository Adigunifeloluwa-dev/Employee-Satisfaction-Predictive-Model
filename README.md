# Employee-Satisfaction-Predictive-Model
This project explores the application of machine learning (ML) to predict employee satisfaction, leveraging two popular algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest Classification. By analysing whether employees would leave an organisation or not.

## Project Structure
The methodology encompasses data pre-processing, cleaning, exploration, and handling of missing values and outliers. 
Feature engineering is performed to standardize input variables, and the dataset is split into training and test sets. Finally, 
KNN and Random Forest Classification models are trained and evaluated.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Two machine learning models are explored:

- **KNN**: A straightforward method that classifies water based on the majority vote of its nearest neighbors.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble technique that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.

Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the models.

1. **Library Importation**: Setup of the Python environment with necessary libraries.
2. **Dataset Importation**: Loading the water potability data from a CSV file.
3. **Data Analysis**: Employing descriptive statistics and data visualization for an in-depth understanding of the dataset.
4. **Data Pre-processing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
5. **Model Training**: Applying machine learning algorithms to the training data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

## Results

The project's findings indicate that the Random Forest Classifier outperforms the KNN model across all evaluation metrics, demonstrating higher efficiency in classifying employee satisfaction.
## Conclusion

The Random Forest model, with its superior performance, is recommended for future deployment in employee satisfaction tasks. Its effectiveness in accurately identifying the satisfaction of employees, whether they would leave or not, underscores its reliability for practical applications.
